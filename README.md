The Music Player Web Application is a front-end project built using React.js that provides a clean and interactive user interface for listening to music. It includes essential features such as play and pause, next and previous track controls, real-time progress tracking, and displays song information like title, artist name, and album artwork. https://music-player-by-vishal.netlify.app/

The application uses React Context API or Redux for efficient global state management, ensuring smooth and consistent music playback across components. HTML5 Audio API is used to handle audio functionality, while Tailwind CSS is applied to create a responsive and modern user interface. This project demonstrates practical experience with component-based architecture, state management, and modern React development best practices. these two points are good but i want only important lines https://music-player-by-vishal.netlify.app/
